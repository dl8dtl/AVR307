AVR307 - ATTiny85 UART Implementation
=====================================
Atmel released an application note (AVR307) which explains how to use the USI module in the attiny85 chip to do half duplex UART communication.
Unfortunately they use the IAR compiler (which is commercial only) to compile the project. 
With this example I am modifying the code in order to work with GCC.

This project uses ATMEL Studio 6 and winavr on a windows 7 box for development.
